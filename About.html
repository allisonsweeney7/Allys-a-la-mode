        <p> <br>Ally's à la Mode is a family company that
started up back in 2014. It all began when
I was a little girl spending the summer
at my grandmother's house while my
parents were working. We would spend
our time together always creating
fun new recipes in the kitchen. For months,
we perfected our cherry pie recipe and
always took the opportunity to share
our creations with our family. In May of
2013, my grandma and I began dreaming
up a plan for a future storefront. After
eight years we are loving every moment
we've spent together in the shop.</p>
